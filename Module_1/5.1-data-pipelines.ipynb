    "Suppose you're a decision maker in the engineering team at an eCommerce company which currently generates millions of dollars in net revenue. You have a legacy system that sits on company's data centers in remote locations, away from the headquarter where your office is. The engineering team and the data analytics team have made the decision that they would like to build a search engine, recommendation engine, and few other engines that require heavy machine learning models to increase the revenue for the company. As a decision maker, you need to assess the current system, and the engineering requirement for the future fiscal years. So you decide to answer some questions and prepare answers for the next leadership meeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the capability of the data center is limited based on the square footage of the location, as well as the hardware that can be stored in the square footage. The data center resource is not only shared in the engineering team, but also within the supply chain team, logistics, HR's IT platform, and also with some other internal operations, like marketing, leadership, and also analytics team. The data centers have maxed out in terms of the hardware that they can support, and may be in need of expanding and opening up another data center."
